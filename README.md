# Restful_API_using_Python
The program will enable to create an Restful API where you can get, post, delete objects from the list.

Here I am using bottle web framework. I have written get, getone, deleteone and post to retrieve json objects, delete json objects and append json objects to the existing object list. 

The list I have choosen is a shoppping products list with two attributes, name and type.

I am also giving the bottle web framework .py file. Do put both your shopping.py and bottle.py in the same directory so you can import the framework.

Do support if you like the work!
